# Book-It


## Description

>This is a book generator app that allows users to make profiles and save their searched books. The user is presented with the landing page and they are able to login in or search books. In order to saved books the user must have an account and be logged in. Once the user is logged in, they are able to search books, by title, by putting one into the text field located at the top of the page. Once the title inserted, they will hit search and be presented with books related to the author of the both they searched and books with similar names or genres. Each book comes with it's own card with a picture of the book, the title, author and the books description. The user is then able to save any books they would like to their profile. If the user would like to see their saved books, they will be able to click on *see your saved books* in the upper right hand corner of the page. Once in the saved books, the user has the option to delete the saved books if they no longer want them by clicking the *delete this book* button at the bottom of each book card.





# Tutorial (How-to start the app)

The app runs on concurrent so both the server and client need to be running in seperate windows but together.

In one window the user will need to cd into the server and run:
```
npm run watch
```
so that the app watches and continuously runs and listens to the backend for events along with the client.

In the next window the user will need to cd into client and run:
```
npm start
```
to start react and run the front end of the app.

*Currently not running (work in progress)
